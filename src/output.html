<strong>Legenda:</strong><br><span style="color:green">positivo</span>, <span style="color:red">negativo</span>, <span style="color:orange">neutro</span><br><br><span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you very much, everybody.</span> <span style="color:green">[Applause] Wow.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you very, very much.</span> <span style="color:green">Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.</span> <span style="color:green">From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.</span> <span style="color:red">We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer.</span> <span style="color:orange">During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.</span> <span style="color:orange">Our sovereignty will be reclaimed.</span> <span style="color:green">Our safety will be restored.</span> <span style="color:green">The scales of justice will be rebalanced.</span> <span style="color:red">The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end.</span> <span style="color:green">And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.</span> <span style="color:green">America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.</span> <span style="color:green">I return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success.</span> <span style="color:green">A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.</span> <span style="color:green">But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.</span> <span style="color:green">While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.</span> <span style="color:red">As we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust.</span> <span style="color:orange">For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.</span> <span style="color:red">We now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.</span> <span style="color:red">It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.</span> <span style="color:green">We have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.</span> <span style="color:red">Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina—who have been treated so badly—and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense.</span> <span style="color:green">They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now.</span> <span style="color:orange">They don't have a home any longer.</span> <span style="color:green">That's interesting.</span> <span style="color:orange">But we can't let this happen.</span> <span style="color:orange">Everyone is unable to do anything about it.</span> <span style="color:orange">That's going to change.</span> <span style="color:red">We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.</span> <span style="color:red">And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them.</span> <span style="color:orange">All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.</span> <span style="color:green">My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom.</span> <span style="color:orange">From this moment on, America's decline is over.</span> <span style="color:green">Our liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied.</span> <span style="color:green">And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's Government.</span> <span style="color:red">Over the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way.</span> <span style="color:red">The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you.</span> <span style="color:green">Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.</span> <span style="color:green">Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear.</span> <span style="color:green">But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason.</span> <span style="color:green">I was saved by God to make America great again.</span> <span style="color:green">[Applause] Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you very much.</span> <span style="color:green">That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.</span> <span style="color:green">We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.</span> <span style="color:orange">For American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day.</span> <span style="color:green">It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.</span> <span style="color:green">As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.</span> <span style="color:green">And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing States—[applause]—and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.</span> <span style="color:green">To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote.</span> <span style="color:green">We set records, and I will not forget it.</span> <span style="color:orange">I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.</span> <span style="color:orange">Today is Martin Luther King Day.</span> <span style="color:green">And his honor—this will be a great honor.</span> <span style="color:green">But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.</span> <span style="color:green">We will make his dream come true.</span> <span style="color:green">[Applause] Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before.</span> <span style="color:green">In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.</span> <span style="color:green">We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God.</span> <span style="color:orange">[Applause] Can't do that.</span> <span style="color:orange">Today I will sign a series of historic Executive orders.</span> <span style="color:orange">With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.</span> <span style="color:orange">It's all about common sense.</span> <span style="color:red">First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border.</span> <span style="color:red">All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.</span> <span style="color:orange">We will reinstate my "Remain in Mexico" policy.</span> <span style="color:orange">I will end the practice of catch-and-release.</span> <span style="color:red">And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.</span> <span style="color:red">Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</span> <span style="color:red">And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.</span> <span style="color:orange">S.</span> <span style="color:orange">soil, including our cities and inner cities.</span> <span style="color:red">As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.</span> <span style="color:orange">We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.</span> <span style="color:red">Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.</span> <span style="color:red">The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.</span> <span style="color:orange">We will drill, baby, drill.</span> <span style="color:red">America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it.</span> <span style="color:orange">We'll use it.</span> <span style="color:green">We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.</span> <span style="color:green">We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.</span> <span style="color:green">With my actions today, we will end the "green new deal," and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers.</span> <span style="color:orange">In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.</span> <span style="color:orange">We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago.</span> <span style="color:green">And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence.</span> <span style="color:orange">We did tremendously with their vote.</span> <span style="color:green">I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families.</span> <span style="color:orange">Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.</span> <span style="color:orange">For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues.</span> <span style="color:green">It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources.</span> <span style="color:green">The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.</span> <span style="color:green">To restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency.</span> <span style="color:red">After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.</span> <span style="color:red">Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about.</span> <span style="color:red">[Laughter] We will not allow that to happen.</span> <span style="color:orange">It will not happen again.</span> <span style="color:green">Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.</span> <span style="color:orange">And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.</span> <span style="color:orange">This week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.</span> <span style="color:green">We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based.</span> <span style="color:green">As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female.</span> <span style="color:red">This week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay.</span> <span style="color:red">And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty.</span> <span style="color:orange">It's going to end immediately.</span> <span style="color:red">Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.</span> <span style="color:green">Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.</span> <span style="color:red">We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.</span> <span style="color:green">My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.</span> <span style="color:green">That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.</span> <span style="color:green">I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.</span> <span style="color:green">[Applause] Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.</span> <span style="color:green">A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.</span> <span style="color:green">President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent—he was a natural businessman—and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States—the United States—I mean, think of this—spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.</span> <span style="color:red">We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken.</span> <span style="color:red">The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.</span> <span style="color:red">American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.</span> <span style="color:green">And that includes the United States Navy.</span> <span style="color:orange">And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal.</span> <span style="color:orange">And we didn't give it to China.</span> <span style="color:orange">We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.</span> <span style="color:green">Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization.</span> <span style="color:green">So, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.</span> <span style="color:orange">We will not be deterred.</span> <span style="color:green">Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.</span> <span style="color:green">The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.</span> <span style="color:orange">And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.</span> <span style="color:green">Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is more ambitious than any other.</span> <span style="color:orange">There's no nation like our Nation.</span> <span style="color:orange">Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.</span> <span style="color:green">The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.</span> <span style="color:green">The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.</span> <span style="color:orange">Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth.</span> <span style="color:red">No one comes close.</span> <span style="color:orange">Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness.</span> <span style="color:green">They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand.</span> <span style="color:green">If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.</span> <span style="color:orange">Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.</span> <span style="color:orange">But as you see today, here I am.</span> <span style="color:orange">The American people have spoken.</span> <span style="color:orange">I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.</span> <span style="color:green">In America, the impossible is what we do best.</span> <span style="color:green">From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.</span> <span style="color:red">They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.</span> <span style="color:green">Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.</span> <span style="color:green">After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4 greatest years in American history.</span> <span style="color:green">With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.</span> <span style="color:green">We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.</span> <span style="color:green">So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.</span> <span style="color:green">We're going to win like never before.</span> <span style="color:green">[Applause] Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:red">In recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly.</span> <span style="color:green">But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.</span> <span style="color:green">We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism.</span> <span style="color:red">Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.</span> <span style="color:green">America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and good will.</span> <span style="color:green">We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.</span> <span style="color:green">We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail.</span> <span style="color:green">From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.</span> <span style="color:green">We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans.</span> <span style="color:orange">The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">God bless America.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you all.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you very much.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you very much.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span> <span style="color:green">Thank you.</span>
